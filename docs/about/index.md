### Undergraduate

As an undergraduate at Bethel University, I worked with [Dr. Brian Ellis](https://www.lipscomb.edu/directory/ellis-brian) (now located at Lipscomb University) and used a health-rating system to evaluate the usefulness of *C. elegans* as a model for anthelmintic study. This work resulted in a [peer-reviewed publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179376) and conference presentations.

I've previously worked as an NSF REU Fellow and research assistant at Notre Dame University with Dr. Joseph O'Tousa
