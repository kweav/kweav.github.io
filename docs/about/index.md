## About -- Training Background

### Undergraduate

I obtained my [B.S. in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/biology-chemistry) and my [B.S. in Mathematics](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/math-engineering-sciences) from Bethel University (Mishawaka, IN).

As an undergraduate at Bethel University, I worked with [Dr. Brian Ellis](https://www.lipscomb.edu/directory/ellis-brian) (now located at Lipscomb University) and used a health-rating system to evaluate the usefulness of *C. elegans* as a model for anthelmintic study. This work resulted in a [peer-reviewed publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179376) and conference presentations.

I've previously worked as an NSF REU Fellow and research assistant at Notre Dame University with [Dr. Joseph O'Tousa](https://www3.nd.edu/~jotousa/labwww/) where I explored the visual system of two mosquito species, *Aedes aegypti* and *Anopheles gambiae*.

And as a summer intern at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I worked with the Bioengineering group and Dr. Angela Tooker to perform post-fabrication electrochemical analysis of neural interface devices, assessing their relative safety.

### Graduate

Due to a combination of all of my undergraduate research experiences, I wanted to join a program that would specifically train me to integrate my math and biology backgrounds in interdisciplinary research.

The [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics (CMDB) program](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University offers exactly this with comprehensive quantitative biology training and many labs that apply quantitative approaches and modeling to their research. Through rotations and thesis research, I have had the honor to research with leading computational biologists, like my original thesis advisor, [James Taylor](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/04/03/james-taylor-obituary-tribute/), and now Rajiv McCoy, following James's unexpected passing.

I am also involved as a teaching assistant in the CMDB program's quantitative biology training courses which originally drew me to the program ([see more here](/about/index.html#graduate))
