### Worm-analysis

Recently, I have begun developing an [open-source, documented, and reproducible Python program](https://github.com/ellis22b/worm-analysis) that replaces the manual analyses used in the paper. Now all these analyses can be automatically performed and figures can be created, all in a fraction of the time. To learn more about this, see [here](/resourcedev/index.html#worm-analysis).
