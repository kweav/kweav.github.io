## About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics (CMDB) program](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/). My research focuses on  

I obtained my [B.S. in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/biology-chemistry) and my [B.S. in Mathematics](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/math-engineering-sciences) from Bethel University (Mishawaka, IN). There, I worked with [Dr. Brian Ellis](https://www.lipscomb.edu/directory/ellis-brian) (now located at Lipscomb University) and used a health-rating system to evaluate the usefulness of *C. elegans* as a model for anthelmintic study. This work resulted in a [peer-reviewed publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179376#ack) and conference presentations. Recently, I have begun developing an [open-source, documented, and reproducible Python program](https://github.com/ellis22b/worm-analysis) that replaces the manual analyses used in the paper. Now all these analyses can be automatically performed and figures can be created, all in a fraction of the time. To learn more about this, see [here](/resourcedev/index.html#worm-analysis)
