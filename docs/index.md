### Research Interests and Background

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics (CMDB) program](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/). My research develops and applies computational models to better understand genome function and evolution. My current research interests use machine learning approaches
* to model gene regulation and predict gene expression across hematopoietic cell types
* to uncover molecular mechanisms contributing to human infertility
* to leverage patterns shared across related datasets to fill in missing data

I obtained my [B.S. in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/biology-chemistry) and my [B.S. in Mathematics](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/math-engineering-sciences) from Bethel University (Mishawaka, IN).
