### Research Interests and Background

I earned my Ph.D. in the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics (CMDB) program](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/). My research developed and applied computational models to better understand genome function and evolution using machine learning approaches
* to model gene regulation and predict gene expression across hematopoietic cell types
* to uncover molecular mechanisms contributing to human infertility
* to leverage patterns shared across related datasets to fill in missing data

I obtained my [B.S. in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/biology-chemistry) and my [B.S. in Mathematics](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/math-engineering-sciences) from Bethel University (Mishawaka, IN).

### Life and Hobbies

My amazing dog Gibbs loves walks, fetch, & helping code. I really enjoy his long walks, all types of needlework projects, music, and reading books.
