## About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics (CMDB) program](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/). My research develops and applies computational models to better understand genome function and evolution. My main projects use machine learning approaches
* to model gene regulation and predict gene expression across hematopoietic cell types
* to uncover molecular mechanisms contributing to human infertility
* to leverage patterns shared across related datasets to fill in missing data

I obtained my [B.S. in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/biology-chemistry) and my [B.S. in Mathematics](https://www.betheluniversity.edu/academics/degrees/math-engineering-sciences) from Bethel University (Mishawaka, IN). There, I worked with [Dr. Brian Ellis](https://www.lipscomb.edu/directory/ellis-brian) (now located at Lipscomb University) and used a health-rating system to evaluate the usefulness of *C. elegans* as a model for anthelmintic study. This work resulted in a [peer-reviewed publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179376) and conference presentations.
